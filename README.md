The vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide non-random amount of variance to the MPG values as p-values are below 0.05.

The slope of the line is not considered to be 0 as the p-value of the model is below 0.05 at 5.35e-11.

This linear model effectively predicts the MPG of MechaCar prototypes as the r-squared value of 0.7149 is considered a strong level of correlation.
