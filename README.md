The vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide non-random amount of variance to the MPG values as p-values are below 0.05.

The slope of the line is not considered to be 0 as the p-value of the model is below 0.05 at 5.35e-11.

This linear model effectively predicts the MPG of MechaCar prototypes as the r-squared value of 0.7149 is a strong level of correlation.

The overall expectation on performance of the suspension coils is that they perform at a mean of 1498.78 PSI, with a variance of 62.29 and standard deviation of 7.89.

Lot 1 requirements are mean PSI of 1500, variance of 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.99

Lot 2 requirements are mean PSI of 1500.20, variance of 7.47 and standard deviation of 2.73

Lot 3 requirements are mean PSI of 1496.14, variance of 170.29 and standard deviation of 13.05

The variability on lot 1 and 2 is much tigher than lot 3, which is driving the overall requirements up.
