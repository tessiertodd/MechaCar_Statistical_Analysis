The vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide non-random amount of variance to the MPG values as p-values are below 0.05.

The slope of the line is not considered to be 0 as the p-value of the model is below 0.05 at 5.35e-11.

This linear model effectively predicts the MPG of MechaCar prototypes as the r-squared value of 0.7149 is a strong level of correlation.

### Statistics by Lot:
![Lot stats](https://github.com/tessiertodd/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Deliverable%202%20-%20lot_summary.png)

The overall expectation on performance of the suspension coils is that they perform at a mean of 1498.78 PSI, with a variance of 62.29 and standard deviation of 7.89.

Lot 1 requirements are mean PSI of 1500, variance of 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.99

Lot 2 requirements are mean PSI of 1500.20, variance of 7.47 and standard deviation of 2.73

Lot 3 requirements are mean PSI of 1496.14, variance of 170.29 and standard deviation of 13.05

The variability on lot 1 and 2 is much tigher than lot 3, which is driving the overall requirements up.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
### T-Test of All Manufacturing Lots Against Mean PSI of Population:
![All lots versus population](https://github.com/tessiertodd/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Deliverable%203%20-%20all%20lots%20together%20versus%20population.png)

Since the p-value of the t-test if more than 0.05 we cannot reject the null hypothesis, and as such the mean of 3 lots together and the population means are statistically similar.


### T-Test of Each of 3 Manufacturing Lots Individually Against Mean PSI of Population:
![Each lot versus population](https://github.com/tessiertodd/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Deliverable%203%20-%20each%20lot%20versus%20population.png)

Since the p-values of the t-test for Lot 1 and Lot 2 are more than 0.05 we cannot reject the null hypothesis, thus their means are statistically similar the population mean. Lot 3 on the other hand with a p-value of 0.04168 is considered statistically different than the population mean of 1500.


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
In order to do a comparison between MechaCar and their competitor, I would recommend we class the different vehicles to ensure we are comparing metrics within a particular class of vehicles, as consumers do that type of comparison when they are looking to buy a vehicle.  I also believe that it would be important for MechaCar to potentially focus on different metrics for the different classes of vehicles. I would like to focus in on the high-performance class of vehicles for MechaCar and their competition. I would like to study a couple of metrics that would be useful for MechaCar to understand how they stand up to their competition in this class - 1) cost per horsepower and 2) time for 0-60mph.

Once we have collected the information from various competitors of MechaCar, we would run a t.test of MechaCar for each of these metrics we have chosen to see how the means compare. Let's assume we had data for 5 competitors, then we would have to run 5 t-tests for each metric to compare MechaCar to each of their competitors.

### Cost/Horsepower:
Null Hypothesis: There is no statistical difference between the ***Cost/Horsepower*** for MechaCar's mean and their competitor's.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a statistical difference between the ***Cost/Horsepower*** for MechaCar's mean and their competitor's.

### Time for 0-60mph:
Null Hypothesis: There is no statistical difference between the ***Time for 0-60mph*** for MechaCar's mean and their competitor's.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a statistical difference between the ***Time for 0-60mph*** for MechaCar's mean and their competitor's.

### Overview of results and recommended next steps:
Once we have run the t-test in R, we will be able to look at the p-values of each of the 10 different tests (5 for each of the two metrics). If the p-values are higher than 0.05 we will not be able to reject the null and MechaCar and that competitor will be considered that their metrics are not statistically different.

Once it has been determined which competitors MechaCar is advantageous on: better to have a lower ***Cost/Horsepower*** and better to have a lower ***Time to 60/mph***, then they would be able to focus on using those advantages in their marketing and sales positioning with potential buyers.
